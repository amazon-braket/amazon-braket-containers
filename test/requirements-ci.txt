# This requirements file lists libraries which are used
# by the unit tests and integration tests, and which are
# also included in the container images.
#
# These packages get installed during GitHub CI runs
# (specified in python-package.yml and integ-tests.yml),
# which run the tests _outside_ the container.
#
# The test framework dependencies themselves should
# be listed in requirements-test.txt.
