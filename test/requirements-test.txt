# This requirements file lists test framework dependencies.
# Since this file is used to install dependencies for tests
# inside the containers, it should not contain any libraries
# which are already present in the container images.
#
# These packages get installed during our container deployment
# validation tests (specified in testspec.yml), which run the
# tests _inside_ the container. Installing packages that are
# already present in the container may cause version mismatches.
#
# Any Braket-related libraries required for execution of unit tests
# or integration tests should be listed in requirements-ci.txt.
